# Regulated AI Workflow Agents — Portfolio

This repository contains a 3-agent portfolio demonstrating guardrailed AI workflow design for regulated environments (healthcare / insurance operations).

### Agent 1 — Healthcare Benefits Support Navigator
Knowledge-grounded rep support agent with citation enforcement, missing-info detection, escalation safeguards, and member-friendly explanation outputs.

### Agent 2 — Texas State Mandates Benefits Navigator
Regulatory retrieval agent using public Texas mandate knowledge with scope guardrails, effective date extraction, and refusal behavior when information is missing.

### Agent 3 — AI Workflow Output Auditor
