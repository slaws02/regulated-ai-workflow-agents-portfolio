# Agent 5 — Self-Insured Paperwork Navigator (Demo)

## Purpose

The Self-Insured Paperwork Navigator is a workflow agent designed to help healthcare insurance and TPA implementation teams identify required paperwork, signatory roles, document dependencies, and sequencing for self-insured (ASO) client implementations.

This agent demonstrates how AI can reduce paperwork complexity and implementation delays by translating scenario inputs into structured document requirement checklists with guardrails and missing-information detection.

This is a portfolio-safe demo using a synthetic paperwork framework — not tied to any specific carrier or proprietary form set.

---

## Business Problem

Self-insured (ASO) implementations require multiple document categories across:

- Administrative services agreements
- Stop-loss policies and attestations
- Claims funding and banking authorizations
- Privacy and data sharing agreements
- EDI and eligibility authorizations
- Network and PBM addenda
- Vendor and third-party delegations

Requirements vary based on funding model, stop-loss structure, banking method, vendor carve-outs, and EDI approach. Missing or mis-sequenced documents commonly delay implementations.

Teams need structured, scenario-driven paperwork guidance — not static checklists.

---

## Solution Approach

This agent uses a structured self-insured paperwork framework knowledge base and produces:

- Required vs conditional document lists
- Signer role mapping
- Document timing guidance
- Dependency sequencing
- Missing input detection
- Risk and delay flags
- Next-step recommendations
- Guardrail refusal for proprietary carrier forms

The agent is knowledge-grounded and will not invent carrier-specific paperwork.

## Key Behaviors

- Distinguishes REQUIRED vs CONDITIONAL documents
- Maps documents to signer roles
- Identifies document dependencies
- Flags sequencing constraints
- Detects missing scenario inputs
- Asks clarifying questions when needed
- Refuses proprietary or out-of-scope requests
- Produces structured implementation checklists
- Uses compliance-safe language

## Data Safety Note

This demo agent uses a synthetic self-insured paperwork framework created solely for portfolio demonstration. No proprietary carrier forms, internal insurer processes, or confidential documents are included or referenced.
